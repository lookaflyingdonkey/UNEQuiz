#UNEQuiz

## Introduction
A simple quiz frontend for the UNE quiz system

This was made to prevent multiple quiz submittions and accidently clicking back in a quiz causing you to get 0%

This is only a proof of concept really but it works all the same.


## Getting Started
1. You can upload both of these files to any server that supports PHP and Curl, or you can run on your local computer. (If uploading please make sure it is secure)
2. Edit proxy.php and put your UNE username/password in, this is used to authenticate against the mcs.une.edu.au server. I advise you only put these in when you are using it and then remove them when you are done.
3. You should now be able to navigate to the quiz.html that you have uploaded and click the "Load Quizzes" button, the quizzes will be pulled in and ready to go.

## Disclaimer
This is only a proof of concept for my own use, this is in no way approved by UNE and no guarantee is given that it will work at all. Always use the UNE system for doing your quizzes. Do not ever use this system for anything but playing around.
